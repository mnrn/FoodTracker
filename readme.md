## Overview

This is a simple meal-tracking app. This app shows a list of meals, including a meal name, rating, and photo. A user can add, remove, or edit a meal. To add a new meal or edit an existing one, users navigate to a different screen where they can specify a name, rating, and photo for a particular meal.

## Development

### Formatting

- **Use 2 spaces to indent lines.**
  - This is the same as [Google Swift Style Guide](https://google.github.io/swift/) and [Airbnb's Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/swift).
  
### Linting

- Configure [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) by `.swiftlint.yml` file.
- Run `swiftlint autocorrect` on build in Xcode.
